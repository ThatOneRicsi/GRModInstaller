# Global Retake Installer

Lightweight Windows installer for [GRMod](https://github.com/Skysion3/GRMod).

This project provides a simple classic-style setup application that downloads the latest GRMod release from GitHub and installs it into a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Legacy folder.

## Download

Download the latest installer from the repository's `Releases` page.

## Installation

1. Launch `GlobalRetakeInstaller.exe`
2. Choose `Full install` or `Patch update`
3. Confirm or change the install folder
4. Let the installer download and extract the latest GRMod release

## Features

- Downloads the latest GRMod release directly from `Skysion3/GRMod`
- Supports both `Full install` and `Patch update`
- Defaults to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\csgo legacy`
- Lets the user choose a custom install folder
- Extracts the selected archive directly into the target folder
- Requests administrator rights for reliable installs inside `Program Files (x86)`
- Auto-detects the Windows UI language
- Includes a built-in language picker inside the installer

## Supported Languages

The installer currently includes these built-in languages:

- Arabic

## How It Works

1. The installer queries the latest GRMod release from GitHub.
2. The user chooses `Full install` or `Patch update`.
3. The archive is downloaded to a temporary folder.
4. The contents are extracted into the selected game directory.
5. Existing files are overwritten during extraction.

## Requirements

- Windows
- Internet connection
- Permission to write to the selected install folder

## Project Notes

- The installer always pulls the latest release at runtime and is not hardcoded to a single GRMod version.
- The application is designed as a single self-contained Windows executable.
- Release metadata and download links are resolved live from GitHub when the installer starts.
